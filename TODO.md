# Todo list
Below are some things that need to be done, as well as some ideas for future development.

- [ ] Setting values on hash map objects.\
	Example:
	* `map[key] = value`
- [ ] Propper error handling. Pretty printed errors with detailed information about the error location, type, and message. Take inspiration from other languages.
- [ ] Implementing the `for` loop.
- [ ] Implementing the `while` loop.


### Future development

- [ ] Range indexing for lists and strings\
	Example:
	* `list[0:2]` returns the first two elements of the list.
	* `list[:-1]` returns the list without the last element.
	* `list[1:]` returns the list without the first element.
