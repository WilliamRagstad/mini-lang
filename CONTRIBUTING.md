# Contribution Guidelines

This document outlines what you need to know before **[creating tickets](#issues-tickets-however-you-may-call-them)**
or **[creating pull requests](#pull-requests)**.

## Issues

Please read the following instructions fully and follow them. You can
help the project tremendously this way: not only do you help the maintainers
to **address problems in a timely manner** but also keep it possible for them
to **fix bugs, add new and improve on existing functionality** instead of doing
nothing but ticket management.
