# The `mini` language

This is the repository for the example programming language `mini` built for the [*Write a language in a week*](https://dev.to/williamragstad/series/17603) series. Read the full series.

The mini language is a very simple programming language that is built for the purpose of teaching programming.
It is not intended to be a full language, but rather a language that can be used to write programs that are short and simple.
